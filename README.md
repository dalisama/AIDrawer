Using Genetic Algorithm to draw painting.
This is a small proof of concept with the Monalisa (22 by 15) scale of grey:

This is 94% of the real deal ;)

You want another proof: this video another [video](https://github.com/dalisama/AIPainter/blob/master/AI%20Painter/AI%20Painter/Monalisa%2030X45%20px/resume%2030x45px.avi "video") 45 by 30, I only got 64.19% accuracy after two days and 17 hours, but given enough time and hardware 99% is easy. I didnâ€™t put it in YouTube because of the weird compression algorithm that distort my images.
